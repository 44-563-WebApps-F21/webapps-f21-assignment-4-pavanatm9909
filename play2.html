        <h3>ACT III. Drawing-Room at the Manor House, Woolton.</h3>
        
        <span> SCENE--</span> <span class="a"> Gwendolen and Cecily are at the window, looking out into the garden.</span>
        <p class= "n1"><span class="name"><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-user">GWENDOLEN.</i></span><br>
            <span class= "char"> The fact that they did not follow us at once into the house, as any one
                else would have done, seems to me to show that they have some sense of
                shame left.

        <p class= "n2"><span class= "name"><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-user">CECILY.</i></span><br>
            <span class= "char"> They have been eating muffins. That looks like repentance.</span></p>

            <span class= "char"><p id ="direct"> [After a pause.] </p> They don’t seem to notice us at all. Couldn’t you
                cough?</span></p>
